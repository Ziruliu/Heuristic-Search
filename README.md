# Heuristic-Search
Instructions:
  1. Run "map_intialization" first to generate 50 differnet maps.
  2. Run "Main" with the command: Main.py filename algorithms_type heuristics_type.
 
 Note:
    Available Alogorithms: 0 = Uniform Cost Search, 1 = A* Search, 2 = Weighted A* Search, 3 = Sequential A* Search
    Available Heuristcs: 0 = Manhattan Distance, 1 = Euclidean Distance, 2 = Chebyshev Distance, 3 = Octile Distance, 4 = Euclidean                                  Distance / 4, 5 = Euclidean Distance, squared
